I monitor my credit report updates weekly/Monthly but did not see the debt reported till mid year ( XX/XX/XXXX ) stating my account was past due since XX/XX/XXXX ( 14 days after the appointment ) or resolved/updated/removed. I have been trying to dispute the multiple inaccuracies from all three Bureau 's for yrs ( amount due, original amount, date opened, etc. ), but somehow the 3 Credit Agencies keep saying this company has met their reporting requirements. I kept asking for proof from both sides to verify this data from the collector &amp; Bureaus, but just kept getting the same answer ( we dont provide statements, we can give you a settlement payoff only ) or hung up on. My credit report has showed a balance due of { {$400.00} } for 5.5 yrs, but 2 of the 3 reporting agencies showed high balance of {$500.00}. Agency 3 of 3 said highest loan amount was {$0.00}, however, when I called the Financial Credit Network company I was told the amount due was { {$600.00} }. So if that is accurate, why do all 3 credit reports dont reflect this increase monthly over time? This is just 1 of many errors i requested proof of in order for this collection to be valid. The letterhead info, balance due, owed, open dates, last reporting dates, etc. doesnt match across all 3 bureau 's which adds more inaccurate info being reported as well. After receiving the payoff letter that i had to yell/demand in writing, just to get some sort of legit proof ( so i can take legal action ), i then wrote to all 3 Credit Bureau 's a very detailed individual letter outlining the inaccuracies across the board as proof of these errors and as of today XX/XX/XXXX, only 1 of these 3 ( XXXX ) has removed it from my report. I have done everything i can to provide these detailed explanations with proof just to keep getting rejected. Maybe its an automated robot investigation and not a human? i dont know, but its not following the laws they are required to do so, therefore i am done trying to explain it over and over to them.

       "      <td>To Whom It May Concern, As a borrower of Santander Consumer USA, I have reached out to the company with my concerns about the auto loan account that I have open with them. I have addressed the fact that I, as a low income borrower, was not aware of the 27.99 % APR on the auto loan, which exceeds California 's usury rate. In fact, they exceed the rate by 17 %. I've been a borrower of theirs for over two years and have not yet paid half to the principal, and have reached out to them with major issues to break down into detail about where my own money was going towards. I have politely asked for refinancing options as well, but was denied this. I have asked for Extended Payment Plan, which they had charged an additional 5 % without notifying me, and the representative over the phone never clarified to me. I have tried my best to keep up with the payments, but feel that I will need to reach out to those of higher authority to help alleviate some stress. My auto loan borrowed was initially {$12000.00} to finance for 60 months. Beginning XXXX of XXXX, I have only paid less than {$1000.00} towards principal which doesn't make any sense, for I've made payments on time prior to my recent financial struggles in the past year of XXXX. I've closed my credit accounts to pay for this auto loan that is clearly a depreciating asset, but none of my money has gone towards the principal of this car. I've kept in contact with Santander about my situation in hopes that our business could become better, but I honestly feel a deep disrespect from the lender as I've tried my best to be cordial. On XX/XX/XXXX on a Thursday evening, I've called to manage my past due balance to bring my account back to current, and was told by 2 separate representatives an amount of {$620.00} made before XX/XX/XXXX would bring my account back up to current. I was not told of any other late fees that would be charged onto my account. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called to confirm this amount and was actually charged an additional {$260.00} onto my account, which was only three business days, and after speaking with a representative and a Supervisior who've clarified the additional charge. I asked to be waived of these extra charges because I was not given this information, and was again denied. If there is a reason for my default, I believe that Santander is in exploit of that. I am not satisfied as a consumer and would like to report this scandal. If Santander strives to be a company of prosperity and respect, they wouldn't dig a deeper threshold for their own consumers. Files will not be included until I receive an e-mail via CFPB. Thank you for your time!</td>\n",

On top of this I don't receive a statement every month from them. I call on the due date or 2-3 days prior to make the payment on the phone.

To me this is not an answer. How can you not view the whole history from when the account was opened? And now i'm being charged late charges.

The interest charge was significant 45 % of the current balance but most importantly I was not notified of the upcoming end of promotional period so that I could pay of the remaining balance. A warning was printed on the statement, but of course I was highly encouraged by Synchrony to sign up for electronic statements which means I never get the actual statement. The monthly bill reminders I receive instead include a minimum payment but make no mention of the ending promotional period. This practice of steering customers to electronic statement and then omitting any promotional balance date information is deceptive and very much in Synchronys best interest. \\n\\nI am immediately sending the outstanding XXXX purchase balance of {$6100.00}.

The dealer proceeded to call my insurance and switch over my policy and registration while I signed paper work with the finance manager who I had to review 5 different contracts with because each time leading up to the XXXX there was a convenient error in the documentation regarding term, payment amount, misc fee 's, or add-on features/benefits. It was remarked that my credit score was outstanding ( XXXX at the time of purchase ). I turned in my previous lease ( XXXX XXXX ) and drove off the lot with a new one ( XXXX XXXX ). Some months later I get a notice that there is an outstanding balance on my previous lease including property taxes ( since paid ), a wear and tear fee, and an additional payment and that this amount if unpaid will be sent to collections. I bring said notice to the dealership, to the sales rep I worked with and inquire as to what this is. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to which he responds he's not sure and that I shouldn't owe anything. He assures me that I should not worry and that he'll reach out to someone at Nissan corporate to find out more info. After waiting awhile I reach out via text and ask for a follow up ( XX/XX/XXXX ) emphasizing that i'm worried the potential impact this will have on my credit score and reminding him of the commitment made in order to secure the sale. He responds with a screen shot of some text exchange with a nissan rep stating that \" we don't waive extra payment, property taxes and miscellaneous ... these are customer responsibility unfortunately sorry '' to which I respond \" That contradicts our agreement doesn't it? '' and I get no response. After waiting for a response I reach out to the nissan consumer affairs and file a complaint ( case # XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I'm told a region manager is going to reach out to me. On XXXX regional manager and I speak apologizing to me for the experience, mentions dealership ( XXXX nissan ) will take care of fees and if I have any questions to feel free to follow up. Sales rep from dealership calls me and asks me to provide a copy of document from collections agency with the amount owed. XXXX I provide a photo of the document via text with no response. I follow up XX/XX/XXXX via text no response. I call the regional manager several times inbetween this first leaving a message stating i've had no follow up from dealership and that I do not need a response from her just a response from dealership. Leave another message requesting she call me back because still no follow up. Leave a third message and call nissan consumer affairs again to update complaint ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Rep updates my complaint. I get a follow up from regional manager who then tells me the dealership manager and sales rep can not find any outstanding debts when calling the finance dept. advises me to reach out to the finance department myself. I reach out to finance dept who transfers me to loss/recovery. Loss/recovery lets me know they see the account, the balances, and gives me the break down. Explains to me that the dealership can call loss/recovery and settle this by overnighting a check for the amount outstanding by providing vehicle vin number. I text sales rep again ( XXXX ) and let him know the good news and the instructions given to me by loss/recovery. He then gives me reasons why he can't help ending his response with \" I honestly don't know what to do because it had nothing to do with us '' I shared that that was a terrible attitude to have and requested his manager give me a call. No response. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I call consumer affairs again requesting to escalate this and was told that the regional manager was the \" higher department '' that this would be escalated to and it would go back to the regional consumer affairs specialist ( same person I've been dealing with who refuses to call me back and has not provided follow up ).

It was an offline transaction occurred on XX/XX/2020 in XXXX, XXXX, where I purchased several stamps from XXXX  XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ). The transaction has been categorized as \" Cash Advance '' by citibank, and I was levied an interest charge because of that. However, to the best of my knowledge, I did not input any PIN into the POS when I made the purchase. \\n\\nI contacted citi via online chat, trying to tell them they have miscategorized the transaction, and politely asked them how I can prevent this from happening again. Yet I was informed that I should not proceed with the transaction when I learned the transaction is a \" Cash Advance ''. However, this sounds a little bit ridiculous to me as a customer would never be able to learn whether a transection is a \" Cash Advance '' before it has been posted in the customer 's statement. This becomes a Catch-22 from my perspective. Further, this offline transaction did not require me to key in any PIN number at all, which has made me more concerned. Doesn't this indicate that a bank could authorize \" Cash Advance '' without a PIN number? If so, how would a customer be able to protect herself from her transaction being miscategorized as \" Cash Advance '' and then exposing herself to the high interets and fees levied by the bank in such an ungrounded manner? How could a customer protect her money if a bank could authorize \" Cash Advance '' without a PIN? \\n\\nEven though the amount involved is marginal, yet the fault in the system reflected in such case, I belive, does warrant more scrutiny and review. I hope CFPB and citibank could look into this case from a systematic perspective, and at least provide customers an option to prevent such \" Cash Advance '' without a PIN from happening, so that customers could be immune from such arbitrary fees and charges, and their hard-earned dollars could be preserved in a way as customers wish. \\n\\nThanks.</td>\n",

The rep said she couldnt disclose this information as I am not on the other account. I asked how they were able to take my money without ANY any type of notice.

I stated that there was an ongoing investigation with the local police department and they were made aware that there were fraudulent charges. My sister XXXX XXXX lives with my parents, has only SSD as her income, has never had XXXX XXXX  and would not be able to manage setting it up on her own.

I asked for a call back number to reach out after seeking legal advice and she said I dont have a direct line. \\n\\nOn the same day, I went to my local TCF bank branch in XXXX MI on XXXX and spoke with the branch manager, XXXX XXXX. I explained the endures situation and requested to close my accounts to avoid them taking any additional money from me. I was told I could not close my accounts due to pending automatic payments.

The police investigation concluded recently and determined that her information was hacked and stolen and then sold on the dark web.

He then offered to connect me, I said go ahead. A lady by the name of \" XXXX XXXX '' ( EXT. XXXX ) answered and said she was from \" XXXX XXXX ''. She explained that XXXX was the 4th \" chain and Title '' of debt owed to Victoria Secret for amount {$390.00} from year XX/XX/XXXX. I was confused, because according to my credit report I had paid off all my credit card debt in the past 3 years ( even old debt ), she claimed Victoria secret does not report to the credit bureau. I told her that I thought I paid this off, she asked for a \" paid in full letter '' and I told her I didn't have my records. She then continued and discussed payment plans/options for me. I said I would need to call her back to verify all the chain and titles. I called back two days later XX/XX/XXXX and left a voicemail asking for a call back. She called back and I asked if she could send a letter to my home with the information of the debt that I owe. She said she could not do that. I asked for a manager. I waited on hold and a \" manager '' came on the line and proceeded to tell me a letter can not be sent, but that they could email me. When they could clearly see my hesitation, he proceeded with very detailed threats like the year, make, and model of my car and that they would be placing a lien on it for this debt. He continued to try and intimidate me with very specific information like my address, job, bank that I bank with etc. He continued with these threats and said if I do not pay they will sue me. I was still hesitant and kindly explained that they must understand my hesitation as I would be giving them sensitive information to pay this debt and with all the fraud out there, it is very scary. I told him that since they refused the one thing I asked for ( a letter by mail ), that I would like to speak to the manager above him. He then placed me on hold and put the another person on the line ; It was very repetitive, almost like a script..I asked for a letter and explained my concerns and he had the same very detailed threats, but when I wasn't budging he laughed and said \" we aren't here to please you or cater to your request, you are the one who owes a debt that you never paid in XX/XX/XXXX, if the debt is not paid you will be sued and it will double in court fees ''. There was a lot of back and fourth about the letter I requested and they refuse to send. He said that he emailed me one and I checked the email it was very plainly made and had no address or header. I told him this and his explanation is that \" they didn't give their address out because of people like me ''. I told him he was being very rude and inconsiderate and he responded with \" you're a joke ''. I told him if they refused to send the letter fine, I will do my research and according to the first lady I had until XX/XX/XXXX to pay the debt at a discount for {$230.00}. I told him we would speak then and hung up.I believe my rights with debt collectors is that they are not allowed to give very detailed threats about taking possession of things such as ; my car. I also realize they can not threaten to sue when there is not in fact a lawsuit in place. They went against my rights and I still do not have confidence this is a reputable company as Victoria Secret DOES report to the credit bureau and XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have a record of XXXX XXXX ANYWHERE.

This is my last resort in trying to remove this fraudulent loan off of my account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1      In XXXX of 2019 I noticed a debt for {$620.00} on my credit which i believed was mine I thought speedy cash had bought one of my old debts and sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "2      As stated from Capital One, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX 2018, My wife and I went to several car dealerships to request for a car loan to get a used car. However, according to their credit requirements unfortunately my credit score was insufficient for the car loan approval at that time. It seemed as though they pulled my credit report multiple times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3      Please see CFPB case XXXX. \\n\\nCapital One, in the letter they provided ( and attached to that case as their response ) said this : \" The funds were reversed and sent back to XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX ''. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX  ( now XXXX XXXX  ) has not received these funds. Staff at XXXX XXXX  - and also staff at the account-holder 's business - have looked for return of my money ( {$650.00} ) and find nothing. \\n\\nCapital One needs to document - actually prove - they returned the funds, as stated in their letter. Capital One must provide electronic information, if the return was made that way, or document the paper check they sent back to XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nI've left 3 messages about this problem for the person who signed the letter ( XXXX ) from Capital One.

       "4      This debt was incurred due to medical malpractice ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX ). I asked the doctor to turn over my claim to his malpractice insurance company. This has cost me thousands of dollars to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am still trying to collect damages from this doctor. He never responded and turned over me to collections Merchants and Professional Collection Bureau , Inc. I sent them a letter describing exactly this issue and instead of not contacting me and verifying my debt they start reporting this debt to the credit reporting agencies. They never verified the debt, like I asked and they never stopped it from being reported when I specifically told them not to, due to the circumstances above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "5      Good Morning We just did a streamline with XXXX XXXX with Guaranteed rates and the one reason why we did a refi was we didn't like XXXX XXXX and when I contacted XXXX she said they don't deal with XXXX XXXX and my loan would never get transferred to there bank. Now we justgot a letter in the mail last week and guess what we have XXXX XXXX. Also I couldof got a streamline loan with XXXX at that time at a lower rate and less money down and XXXX also knew this too. So this company took advantage of us and made us spend more money to to wind up with the same Lender we had to begin with and don't want!! Is there anything I can do to sue this company? \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "6      I have false, negative claims on my credit report do to identity theft back in XX/XX/XXXX. These false claims are preventing me from purchasing a house at good rates for my family and I. There is a claim by XXXX XXXX XXXX  stating I had an account with them in XX/XX/XXXX. I have never done any business with XXXX XXXX XXXX  what so ever in my life. XXXX XXXX XXXX  states I then charged a XXXX to that account and never paid the balance of {$300.00} USD. At the time of the identity theft I was banking with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and was notified by them about the matter. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me to sign a Police Affidavit stating that it was a case of identity theft. I then signed a police affidavit and submitted it back to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I thought everything was done with the issue being as though the money was never charged to my account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX Bank then started making harassing calls to me as well as sending threatening letter saying \" if I don't pay the balance they were gon na send it to a debt collection agency. I tried explaining the facts of the matter to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Trying to tell them that I never had any business dealing with them and that was a case of Identity theft. They wouldn't listen. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was in the process of purchasing my first home. My credit was checked and a debt of {$380.00} USD showed on my report. The debt was being enforced by Midland Funding and was a result of XXXX XXXX XXXX  transferring the debt to them. I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX  to inform them I never opened an account with them once again and they just wouldn't listen to me. XXXX XXXX XXXX  would just keep hanging the phone up on me. I contacted Midland Funding to inform them of the Identity theft that occurred with XXXX XXXX XXXX  pertaining to the exact same debt they were attempting to recover. They were not listening and continue to send letters to me to retrieve the amount. I have tried disputing the debt with the credit bureau and nothing has happened. I hired an attorney to clean up this matter for me and ended up paying them more than the amount the debt is, still nothing has happened. I refuse to pay for goods never rendered to me. I refuse to be another American being rail road by XXXX XXXX XXXX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "7      I have been in the middle of a refinance for about 6 months. So I would not have opened any new credit. I received an email stating that there is a late payment on my credit for a PPC account. I never opened up this account and now there is no one to speak to at paypal regarding this!!! Again, I am in the middle of a refinance on my house and my credit score just dropped only who knows how much because of a missed payment on an account that I didn't open up and there is not one single person to speak with about it. Oh goodness I am over the moon with frustration right now. The reporting agency can report a derogatory status on my account but not answer phone calls! Is that even legal? Shame on you Paypal! I sincerely hope there is something you will do to fix this. I have not been late on a payment in years ... ugh It is item number 17 on my credit report at the top of page 10/33.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "8      On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from a debt collection company called Transworld Systems Inc. The letter itself states I have thirty days to dispute or pay a debt of {$170.00}, failure to communicate with them in thirty days results in admittance of debt, and that this debt was obtained from a creditor named XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX states they formally held this debt from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX. As for my actions, I notified a credit bureau to place a temporary fraud alert to protect my identity, and I notified this Transworld Systems Inc that I am disputing the debt. I lived in XXXX and utilized XXXX XXXX XXXX as my power company from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I never had a delinquent account with them and I paid off my final bill in XX/XX/XXXX ( I moved from XXXX, XXXX  to XXXX  at the end of XX/XX/XXXX ). This is the first time in almost thirteen years I've been notified of any type of debt, and I believe that one or  more of the above companies is incorrect and possibly \" scamming '' me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "9      This morning, I received an email from Citi telling me they had closed my credit card account. No prior warning - no prior communication of any kind. \\nI have had the card for 10 yrs with a spotless record of paying for charges in a timely fashion. \\nI called Citi and informed them of what had happened and asked for an explanation. A customer service employee told me a letter had just been sent explaining the situation but he couldn't give any more information because of my privacy rights. I asked to speak to a supervisor. \\nA supervisor pulled up the letter sent to me and told me my account had been closed for \" non-usage '' and explained I had not used the card in at least 2 yrs. I countered that was probably true, I had several cards and I used each of them according to the scenario and I was sure, if he cared to look back, that there had been other 2 yr periods over the past 10 yrs when I had not used my Citi Card. I asked if I had ever signed any agreement or had been informed by Citi of their \" use it or lose it '' policy. The supervisor told me no, they simply had the right to close my account at any time for any reason. \\nAs you know, this affects my credit rating negatively and I informed the supervisor of the same. I think it patently unfair that my credit rating will go down - which could affect future credit requests on my part - simply because Citi precipitously cancelled my account. Further, I find it patently unfair that Citi cancelled my account, although I have never missed or been late on a payment to them, without some sort of warning. \\nI will never use Citi again - for anything - but I find their policy as practiced on me to be anti-consumer and one they should be forced to change or at the least modify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "10     I initially contacted the creditor ( Financial Credit Network ) to resolve this debt, but not getting info by law i should have. I provided all necessary insurance information from my primary insurance coverage in XXXX XXXX for my XXXX, I was told that the XXXX  facility would take care of the billing and that my co-pay was {$100.00}. I made the Co-payment in order to proceed with the XXXX  appointment and the billing staff informed me they would get back with me the following day if any issues came up. Since I did not get a call back I assumed that insurance had taken care of the bill ( Billing Dept confirmed prior, if nothing is wrong, then you are good ). I monitor my credit report updates weekly/Monthly but did not see the debt reported till mid year ( XX/XX/XXXX ) stating my account was past due since XX/XX/XXXX ( 14 days after the appointment ) or resolved/updated/removed. I have been trying to dispute the multiple inaccuracies from all three Bureau 's for yrs ( amount due, original amount, date opened, etc. ), but somehow the 3 Credit Agencies keep saying this company has met their reporting requirements. I kept asking for proof from both sides to verify this data from the collector & Bureaus, but just kept getting the same answer ( we dont provide statements, we can give you a settlement payoff only ) or hung up on. My credit report has showed a balance due of { {$400.00} } for 5.5 yrs, but 2 of the 3 reporting agencies showed high balance of {$500.00}. Agency 3 of 3 said highest loan amount was {$0.00}, however, when I called the Financial Credit Network company I was told the amount due was { {$600.00} }. So if that is accurate, why do all 3 credit reports dont reflect this increase monthly over time? This is just 1 of many errors i requested proof of in order for this collection to be valid. The letterhead info, balance due, owed, open dates, last reporting dates, etc. doesnt match across all 3 bureau 's which adds more inaccurate info being reported as well. After receiving the payoff letter that i had to yell/demand in writing, just to get some sort of legit proof ( so i can take legal action ), i then wrote to all 3 Credit Bureau 's a very detailed individual letter outlining the inaccuracies across the board as proof of these errors and as of today XX/XX/XXXX, only 1 of these 3 ( XXXX ) has removed it from my report. I have done everything i can to provide these detailed explanations with proof just to keep getting rejected. Maybe its an automated robot investigation and not a human? i dont know, but its not following the laws they are required to do so, therefore i am done trying to explain it over and over to them. Please help, They refuse to remove all these errors and its really effecting my score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "11     To Whom It May Concern, As a borrower of Santander Consumer USA, I have reached out to the company with my concerns about the auto loan account that I have open with them. I have addressed the fact that I, as a low income borrower, was not aware of the 27.99 % APR on the auto loan, which exceeds California 's usury rate. In fact, they exceed the rate by 17 %. I've been a borrower of theirs for over two years and have not yet paid half to the principal, and have reached out to them with major issues to break down into detail about where my own money was going towards. I have politely asked for refinancing options as well, but was denied this. I have asked for Extended Payment Plan, which they had charged an additional 5 % without notifying me, and the representative over the phone never clarified to me. I have tried my best to keep up with the payments, but feel that I will need to reach out to those of higher authority to help alleviate some stress. My auto loan borrowed was initially {$12000.00} to finance for 60 months. Beginning XXXX of XXXX, I have only paid less than {$1000.00} towards principal which doesn't make any sense, for I've made payments on time prior to my recent financial struggles in the past year of XXXX. I've closed my credit accounts to pay for this auto loan that is clearly a depreciating asset, but none of my money has gone towards the principal of this car. I've kept in contact with Santander about my situation in hopes that our business could become better, but I honestly feel a deep disrespect from the lender as I've tried my best to be cordial. On XX/XX/XXXX on a Thursday evening, I've called to manage my past due balance to bring my account back to current, and was told by 2 separate representatives an amount of {$620.00} made before XX/XX/XXXX would bring my account back up to current. I was not told of any other late fees that would be charged onto my account. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called to confirm this amount and was actually charged an additional {$260.00} onto my account, which was only three business days, and after speaking with a representative and a Supervisior who've clarified the additional charge. I asked to be waived of these extra charges because I was not given this information, and was again denied. If there is a reason for my default, I believe that Santander is in exploit of that. I am not satisfied as a consumer and would like to report this scandal. If Santander strives to be a company of prosperity and respect, they wouldn't dig a deeper threshold for their own consumers. Files will not be included until I receive an e-mail via CFPB.

       "12     I have a previous complaint in on syncrony bank/care credit card. I wish to add additonal information. Today I received a statment. Upon reviewing the statement I noticed I was charged {$83.00} in fees. I immediately contact sycrony bank to discuss this. I was told that I am past due on my payment. I explained to them that I only made 1 purchase on this card back in XXXX. It is a no interest card if paid in full by XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX. From day 1 monthly payments are {$160.00} However the past few months the monthly payment is going up I explained how can this be if the balance is going down why is the monthly payment going up? On top of this I don't receive a statement every month from them. I call on the due date or 2-3 days prior to make the payment on the phone. They have no right to tell me that I'm not making the full miminum monthly payment that is required. As I stated prior from day 1 the minimum monthly payment is {$160.00}. Now they reported me to the 3 credit reporting agency 's as being 30 days late. This is completely wrong. The customer service rep was unable to go back the prior months to see why this is happening. To me this is not an answer. How can you not view the whole history from when the account was opened? And now i'm being charged late charges. I myself tried to view the account from 8 months ago and the system will not allow me to do so. I've had nothing with problems with this bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "14     Complaint sent to Synchrony on XX/XX/2020 for Synchrony 's application of retroactive deferred interest without notification. I have received no acknowledgement or response from the company either in writing or online. {$6100.00} was sent on XX/XX/XXXX electronically and applied to the account balance by Synchrony. The retroactive interest charge has not been removed from the account. \\n\\nComplaint sent by letter : \" I recently discovered we were charged deferred interest in XX/XX/2020 for a remaining credit amount on a XXXX carpet purchase, account. The interest charge was significant 45 % of the current balance but most importantly I was not notified of the upcoming end of promotional period so that I could pay of the remaining balance. A warning was printed on the statement, but of course I was highly encouraged by Synchrony to sign up for electronic statements which means I never get the actual statement. The monthly bill reminders I receive instead include a minimum payment but make no mention of the ending promotional period. This practice of steering customers to electronic statement and then omitting any promotional balance date information is deceptive and very much in Synchronys best interest. \\n\\nI am immediately sending the outstanding XXXX purchase balance of {$6100.00}. I ask that you remove/credit my account for the total interest charge of {$2700.00} added to the balance on XX/XX/2020. There are two additional monthly payments from XXXX and XX/XX/2020 which may result in over crediting the account, these can be dealt with separately.

       "15     Went to dealership ( XXXX Nissan ) to explore options for trading in my previous lease XX/XX/XXXX and was assured by the sales person that if I were to purchase a new lease that day all fees around maintenance, and return fees would be covered by the dealer and that I would purchase with no downpayment required only my first month payment. The dealer proceeded to call my insurance and switch over my policy and registration while I signed paper work with the finance manager who I had to review 5 different contracts with because each time leading up to the XXXX there was a convenient error in the documentation regarding term, payment amount, misc fee 's, or add-on features/benefits. It was remarked that my credit score was outstanding ( XXXX at the time of purchase ). I turned in my previous lease ( XXXX XXXX ) and drove off the lot with a new one ( XXXX XXXX ). Some months later I get a notice that there is an outstanding balance on my previous lease including property taxes ( since paid ), a wear and tear fee, and an additional payment and that this amount if unpaid will be sent to collections. I bring said notice to the dealership, to the sales rep I worked with and inquire as to what this is. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to which he responds he's not sure and that I shouldn't owe anything. He assures me that I should not worry and that he'll reach out to someone at Nissan corporate to find out more info. After waiting awhile I reach out via text and ask for a follow up ( XX/XX/XXXX ) emphasizing that i'm worried the potential impact this will have on my credit score and reminding him of the commitment made in order to secure the sale. He responds with a screen shot of some text exchange with a nissan rep stating that \" we don't waive extra payment, property taxes and miscellaneous ... these are customer responsibility unfortunately sorry '' to which I respond \" That contradicts our agreement doesn't it? '' and I get no response. After waiting for a response I reach out to the nissan consumer affairs and file a complaint ( case # XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX. I'm told a region manager is going to reach out to me. On XXXX regional manager and I speak apologizing to me for the experience, mentions dealership ( XXXX nissan ) will take care of fees and if I have any questions to feel free to follow up. Sales rep from dealership calls me and asks me to provide a copy of document from collections agency with the amount owed. XXXX I provide a photo of the document via text with no response. I follow up XX/XX/XXXX via text no response. I call the regional manager several times inbetween this first leaving a message stating i've had no follow up from dealership and that I do not need a response from her just a response from dealership. Leave another message requesting she call me back because still no follow up. Leave a third message and call nissan consumer affairs again to update complaint ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Rep updates my complaint. I get a follow up from regional manager who then tells me the dealership manager and sales rep can not find any outstanding debts when calling the finance dept. advises me to reach out to the finance department myself. I reach out to finance dept who transfers me to loss/recovery. Loss/recovery lets me know they see the account, the balances, and gives me the break down. Explains to me that the dealership can call loss/recovery and settle this by overnighting a check for the amount outstanding by providing vehicle vin number. I text sales rep again ( XXXX ) and let him know the good news and the instructions given to me by loss/recovery. He then gives me reasons why he can't help ending his response with \" I honestly don't know what to do because it had nothing to do with us '' I shared that that was a terrible attitude to have and requested his manager give me a call. No response. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I call consumer affairs again requesting to escalate this and was told that the regional manager was the \" higher department '' that this would be escalated to and it would go back to the regional consumer affairs specialist ( same person I've been dealing with who refuses to call me back and has not provided follow up ). I inform rep to document my intentions to file a complaint with CFPB as well as XXXX and a formal complaint to the corporate offices due to this incompetence.   \n",

       "17     I write to complain about an interest charged on my citibank credit card. It was an offline transaction occurred on XX/XX/2020 in XXXX, XXXX, where I purchased several stamps from XXXX  XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ). The transaction has been categorized as \" Cash Advance '' by citibank, and I was levied an interest charge because of that. However, to the best of my knowledge, I did not input any PIN into the POS when I made the purchase. \\n\\nI contacted citi via online chat, trying to tell them they have miscategorized the transaction, and politely asked them how I can prevent this from happening again. Yet I was informed that I should not proceed with the transaction when I learned the transaction is a \" Cash Advance ''. However, this sounds a little bit ridiculous to me as a customer would never be able to learn whether a transection is a \" Cash Advance '' before it has been posted in the customer 's statement. This becomes a Catch-22 from my perspective. Further, this offline transaction did not require me to key in any PIN number at all, which has made me more concerned. Doesn't this indicate that a bank could authorize \" Cash Advance '' without a PIN number? If so, how would a customer be able to protect herself from her transaction being miscategorized as \" Cash Advance '' and then exposing herself to the high interets and fees levied by the bank in such an ungrounded manner? How could a customer protect her money if a bank could authorize \" Cash Advance '' without a PIN? \\n\\nEven though the amount involved is marginal, yet the fault in the system reflected in such case, I belive, does warrant more scrutiny and review. I hope CFPB and citibank could look into this case from a systematic perspective, and at least provide customers an option to prevent such \" Cash Advance '' without a PIN from happening, so that customers could be immune from such arbitrary fees and charges, and their hard-earned dollars could be preserved in a way as customers wish. \\n\\nThanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "19     My mortgage was transferred from XXXX to Shellpoint in XX/XX/XXXX and they said that my insurance had been cancelled which was not true. I sent them proof on insurance from XX/XX/XXXX forward which showed insurance was never cancelled. Then they sent me second letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which I received XX/XX/XXXX that said I did not show coverage for the month of XX/XX/XXXX ( letter attached ) so they would place insurance for that 1 month and charge me {$77.00} I immediately emailed them proof of insurance for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. ( see attached email and proof of insurance for the month of XXXX XXXX ). But as you can see from the last letter they are charging me the insurance premium of {$77.00} for the month of XX/XX/XXXX anyway. I have made a number of calls to them and this has not been resolved. \\nThank you, XXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "20     We went to Schomp Honda at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CO XXXX to look at a vehicle they had posted on there website a XXXX XXXX XXXX, we test drove said vehicle and then talked to the salesman about the vehicle having no warranty he assured us that they had done a 125 point inspection and found that the head gasket had to be replaced and that there was no warranty due to that repair, but everything else had checked out ok. Within 2or 3 weeks the engine light came on, we took it in to be checked out by an outside auto shop and found out the problem was a bad engine that could not be fixed internal engine failure. {$11000.00} to replace then while they were finishing the inspection they said the 4 wheel drive system which is the  vtm was also going out along with the front and rear brakes that were so bad that we could have been in a very bad car accident, we were lucky that we took it in, and on top of that the cv joints and the struts were also shot bringing the total to about {$15000.00} dollars we contacted the dealer on XX/XX/122020 and they stated it was not there problem, they stated the car was sold as is. But what kind of a reputable dealer would put peoples lives at risk just to make money, then not even care. So the more i thought about it the more upset i got because now that they choose not to do anything about it, if i take this XXXX XXXX XXXX in to trade for another vehicle i am going to have to do the honest thing and disclose everything wrong with the vehicle and probably being stuck with about {$8000.00} worth of negative equity towards purchasing another vehicle. I then contacted the dealership again on XX/XX/2020 to try and resolve this matter by bringing back the XXXX XXXX XXXX and get my trade in money for my vehicle and my down payment money so i could look at another vehicle, again they turned me down and said they might consider taking the truck back but well below what i paid them for it and not receive any of my trade in allowance or my cash down money, stated thats not happening. This is why i am reaching out to you because they dont give a XXXX about myself or my wife just the money. This dealership should be put out of business and fined for the way they take advantage of people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

Plus several medical bills as I am a XXXX XXXX veteran exposure to XXXX  XXXX  and doing the best I can to solve all these problems. \\nI sent Mr. Cooper XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX which I was sending another XXXX by they end of this week. Which brings me up to date with the mortgage. Mr Cooper advises that they will not except the payment even though they have already process the first XXXX and will not return it so I can't pay the full amount of XXXX. to bring the loan current.

The money has not been earning interest and Citi has not responded as to why it has been more than 5 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "24     On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that my XXXX old son was the victim of a click-through scam by NetSpend. More specifically, my minor son shared that he was watching sports car videos on XXXX when he was solicited by various pop ups to see \" fast cars. '' Upon clicking the pop ups, he was asked for his personal information ( e.g., name and address ). My minor son shared that he did not enter his date of birth. And he does not know his social security number, so it begs the question how NetSpend was able to issue a PrePaid card in his name - especially as it is unlawful for credit to be opened for a minor. Following a call with NetSpend, it has closed the account. I intend to file a complaint with NetSpend corporate offices, as well as freeze my son 's credit. Additionally, I wanted to file a complaint with the CFBP about the improper activity relating to a minor. \\n\\nShould you have any follow-up questions or need additional information, please contact me by email at XXXX. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "26     On XX/XX/2020, I ended the day with an available balance of {$1000.00} in my checking account On XX/XX/2020, I made a payment of {$1000.00} to pay my credit card On XX/XX/2020, I was charged a Non-Sufficient Fund fee of {$38.00}. When I called in to inquire about this fee, I was told that a hold was put on my check deposit so even though the display balance was {$1000.00}, my actual balance was only {$500.00}. The agent offered to waive the fee and I accepted. I confirmed that this time my available balance was the full amount {$1000.00} On XX/XX/2020, I tried to re-make the same payment of {$1000.00} to my credit card. I double checked that both my available balance and my posted balance was {$1000.00}. After I made the payment, the balance dropped to XXXX On XX/XX/2020, I was again charged a Non-Sufficient Fund fee of {$38.00}. BBVA seems to engage in deceptive practices of charge NSF fee when not applicable, or purposely hides the true balance of an account so customer would incur NSF fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "28     I have been a solid Chase Visa client for some twenty years, and have always paid my due payments on time. Because of that, my credit score is over 800 points. In XX/XX/XXXX, I have noticed massive amounts of charges coming from a company called XXXX. The charges were made from fifty-three ( 53 ) XXXX rides between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, to the tune of {$650.00}, which translates roughly into one XXXX ride more than every other day for these three months. Since our ( my wife, kids and I ) usual pattern is to use XXXX perhaps once every other month or less for $ XXXX per ride, upon examination of my statement in early XXXX, on  XX/XX/XXXX I called VISA 's fraud department to report the fraudulent use of my card. \\n\\nOn XXXX XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from Visa 's Fraud department acknowledging the fraudulent charges, temporary removal of charges associated with them, pending investigation, which should have been a normal and final resolution of the case. \\n\\nTo my delight, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX stating that during the investigation it was determined that the charges were fraudulent and they will be permanently removed. \\n\\nUnfortunately in XX/XX/XXXX, for very unknown to this day reason, all the fraud charge removals were reversed and I received a XX/XX/XXXX bill with {$650.00} charged back to my card!\\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I had at least five long discussions with various people, mostly from now \" Recovery Department '' who must have been given an order to deny fraud claims, perhaps, so XX/XX/XXXX could look better on their books? I talked to ( XXXX ) XXXX from XXXX, then was told to call XXXX XXXX   at extension : XXXX ( who promised to send me a proof for the claim validity and never did ), then the other two I do not remember, and now XXXX at extension : XXXX. All sr. Specialists II, Fraud Department, or Recovery Department. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX, Sr Specialist II, Fraud Department where hse states the following : \" We have reviewed your claim again ; here is what we found. Our latest review confirms the \" previous finding that the transactions are valid ''. After calling and talking to her she has promised to send me a proof based on which she made that decision, but instead, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received the same letter from a new Sr. Specialist - XXXX ( XXXX ext. XXXX ). \\n\\nI am lost. \\n\\nConsequently, after countless phone calls with the Visa Freud \" Recovery '' Department in XXXX and XXXX, being extremely, extremely frustrated with their total disdain towards me and utter lack of response or providing any proof that would validate the charges ( they have told me that they have received it from the XXXX ), I  have resorted to filing this complaint and starting to consult with the legal professionals. \\n\\nKind regards, XXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "29     On XX/XX/2020 I received notice that a collection account had been added to my XXXX   report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX At this point I had not been provided anything in writing explaining this alleged debt. I sent them a validation letter which I mailed certified on XX/XX/2020. On XX/XX/2020 I received a letter NOT from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but some company named Nelson Cruz & Associates claiming that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was their client, and that I had an outstanding balance of XXXX which was assigned to their office on XX/XX/2020. Upon research I found that they are also a debt collection agency who is working under guise of a law office for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to trick consumers into paying invalidated debts. I also sent the alleged law office a letter asking them to validate the alleged debt on XX/XX/2020, and have yet to hear back. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX during which I asked the representative XXXX if they had gotten the letter she advised that they had received it. She advised that they would be sending a response soon I ended advising that I would wait for the letter before discussing anything further with them. However a few hours later I received yet another alert from XXXX advising that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had hard pulled my credit report for an installment loan. I did not authorize them to pull my report and further they are a collection agency not a creditor who provides loans. I presume they pulled my report due to them trying to obtain information to validate the alleged debt. \\n\\nAdditionally, the alleged debt upon research is for a company called XXXX XXXX who is no longer in business and have not been for at least 4 years.

       "57424  I had a credit card with US Bank. The credit card was opened XX/XX/XXXX and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I no longer have the card. It says i owe {$290.00} on it and it was charged off. I keep having a derogatory 30 day late payment on my credit report every month up to the current date of XX/XX/XXXX even though the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I've contacted the bank and their credit card services the see how I can resolve this but no one can find my account or how if I have a balance how to pay it so this will stop. Ive have not received any letters or bills stating an amount owed they just keep posting it to my credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "57426  From the first date, I have always included a partial pre-payment of my principle. When the COVID-19 Pandemic shut down XXXX Florida, I called Select Portfolio Servicing and asked them two questions ; 1 )  would they lower the variable interest rate, which they increased last year, 2 ) what options do I have if I have a problem making the payments Today, I received my statement. The pre-payment of {$270.00} was unapplied, even though the mortgage coupon was clearly marked for partial pre-payment. Rather than following their customer 's wishes, they continue to charge interest charges for the {$270.00} ( and future ) pre-payments. \\nAt XXXX XXXX, I called, I was informed that I was enrolled in their \" forbearance '' program and they told me that I could not withdraw from it.

       "57427  On XX/XX/2020, TCF withdrew {$1000.00} from my checking account. The transaction showed up as a transfer to account XXXX. I contacted customer service immediately upon seeing this on XX/XX/2020 ( call made at XXXX ). The customer service rep told me that it was a transfer to another account that had a negative balance. I knew that my sister, XXXX XXXX, had a negative account due to fraudulent charges through XXXX and asked if it was her account. The rep said she couldnt disclose this information as I am not on the other account. I asked how they were able to take my money without ANY any type of notice. The customer service rep told that XXXX XXXX is on both accounts and thus, they could do that. I stated that there was an ongoing investigation with the local police department and they were made aware that there were fraudulent charges. My sister XXXX XXXX lives with my parents, has only SSD as her income, has never had XXXX XXXX  and would not be able to manage setting it up on her own. TCF was put on notice within 24 hours of the hack/fraudulent charges when these were discovered by my mom XXXX XXXX. \\nI requested to speak to manager after no resolution with the customer service rep. I was transferred to XXXX and she was extremely rude and sarcastic. She told me that they have a right to take money any way they can to bring a negative account positive. I told her that I would be unable to make my mortgage payment, car payment and other payments with the money they stole from me. Her response was to ask your mother for that money back. I asked for a call back number to reach out after seeking legal advice and she said I dont have a direct line. \\n\\nOn the same day, I went to my local TCF bank branch in XXXX MI on XXXX and spoke with the branch manager, XXXX XXXX. I explained the endures situation and requested to close my accounts to avoid them taking any additional money from me. I was told I could not close my accounts due to pending automatic payments. They said I could come back once all my payments were no longer pending. \\n\\n1-2 weeks later ( exact date unknown ), I received a letter ( only addressed to XXXX XXXX ) stating that I was previously notified that my account ending in XXXX was overdrawn. The notice then said that they transferred {$1000.00} to my account ending in XXXX. The account ending in XXXX is NOT associated with my name and never has been. That account is my sister XXXX XXXX account, and my mother XXXX XXXX is secondary. \\nSince XXXX, TCF bank has taken XXXX SSD to cover her negative balance as well as {$1000.00} from my account. This still wasnt enough money taken to bring XXXX account balance to {$0.00}, so TCF sent her collection letters, and theyve now turned her over to a collection agency. The police investigation concluded recently and determined that her information was hacked and stolen and then sold on the dark web. Despite these findings, TCF is still refusing to reimburse her the funds that that were fraudulently stolen. TCF has been nothing but rude and unhelpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "57428  On XX/XX/XXXX my USAA checking and savings account was hacked and {$400.00} was taken out via a XXXX transaction. The individual also attempted to open a credit card in our name but was denied. We discovered the issue within hours and called USAA to report it. The next day I was sent a message saying that no fraudulent activity was discovered and my claim was denied. I called back and asked for more information but was told I would have to have the fraud analyst call me within 3-5 business days. I never received a call and everytime I call USAA back they cant explain why no one has called me back and they tell they will resubmit the request and to wait another 3-5 business days. We have never used XXXX with USAA and did not authorize the transfer or attempt to open a credit card. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX we have no explanation of why the claim was denied and no recourse to take with USAA. The electronic fund transfer act clearly states that we are not liable for the loss of these funds. USAA will not explain their decision to us so far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "57429  I had an account with Bank of America for twelve years I had paid over {$1500.00} Every year for overdraft fees. There was one year they had really taken advantage of my weekly paychecks and I paid over {$3600.00} because my purchases would be manipulated. Every purchased I made I would check on my account if they went through before making another one. I would go back to check again and the same purchase that had already been processed was rearranged so I would get hit with overdraft fees. Plus when I worked for XXXX and XXXX I would ask exactly when the checks would be in my account they told me days prior to when Bank of America claimed I did. BOA got my deposits they just wouldnt let it be available to me until days after receiving it. I have had check payments missing and no one has any answers for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "57432  XXXX has my loan for our car that was totaled in XX/XX/2019. My insurance company and I have been calling weekly over the last two months attempting to get a letter of guarantee to get the loan paid off. XXXX has changed their story every time we call. I was told the letter was sent back in XXXX then it was they needed additional information from the Insurance company which was received on XX/XX/XXXX. Then it was they had the wrong fax number then it was the letter was never created as the total loss department is backed up. Then last week i was told that the total loss department is caught up but mine was overlooked. They can't communication with the Total loss department other than email. There is no way to call them. I have called 1-2 times a week and keep being told i have to wait there is nothing they can do. Multiple emails have been sent by my insurance company and the customer service team to this total loss team, but yet not one of them have been responded too. My husband and I both work and have a XXXX XXXX XXXX. We need 2 cars, we have had a hard time getting another loan as this one is still reflecting on our credit report over 2 months after it's been totaled. We had to get a loan for a new car with a higher than we ever had interest rate and we can't afford to pay three car payments. So now this loan is behind and they are reporting it to our credit when it should have been paid off over two months ago but we are waiting on them. I talked to two supervisors over the phone with customer service who keep telling me i'm XXXX there is nothing they can do as they can only email the total loss team. The stress and time i have put into this totaled car over the last three months is ridiculous. How can a company 's only contact with a department be by email? XXXX is gaining interest and fee on this account by not allowing us to pay it off. But yet i have to continue to take time out of my already busy schedule to call and get told that i have to wait longer. I have been waiting long enough! All the insurance company needs is the letter of guarantee and this loan could be paid off.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "57433  I received an email from American Express today. They closed my account. They stated it was because of some delinquencies on my credit report through XXXX. I have a fraud alert on my account with XXXX   for over 5 years. That item that they are referring to is being disputed as fraud. For the entire 4 years almost that I have had my credit card I have never once made a late payment. I spoke with a person named XXXX. Someone was in the background laughing. I am not appreciative that no consideration was given as I am a fraud victim. I can be reached at XXXX to get this rectified. They never gave me an increase the entire time that I had this account. I am not happy with this issue at all and the fact that my score will decrease because this account is being closed. I would appreciate reconsideration given. Please see attached police report and a copy of my DL to verify my identity. I look forward to this being resolved. Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "57434  I am selling my home and the title company attempted to obtain a payoff from Freedom Mortgage on XX/XX/2020. No response was made with the title company ( XXXX XXXX ) reaching out again on XX/XX/2020 with the 2nd request, twice in that day. On XX/XX/XXXX, Freedom finally responded stating they were unable to move forward with the request because the signature on the auth did not match the name on the loan. ( I had gotten married since buying the house and had a name change, however the loan number and social sec number were correct on the auth ). On XX/XX/2020, XXXX XXXX resubmitted the auth again in the new name. No response from the mortgage company. On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX XXXX reached out again for the request stating that the closing date was set and we needed the payoff info ASAP. No response from Freedom. The title company AGAIN reached out on XX/XX/XXXX asking for a status as the closing was set for XX/XX/XXXX. Still no response. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX reached out to me asking if I would personally call to attempt to get the information. XXXX also called Freedom Mortgage and was told they have no other requests in their system other than when I called to personally ask for the information myself on XX/XX/XXXX. There is a documentation trail of all these requests and dates with Freedom not complying with the request. Freedom informed me that they have \" 7-10 days '' to respond to anything and they are saying they will NOT give me the information until Friday XX/XX/XXXX which is 72 additional hours from when I called myself for the info. Due to the fact they are unwilling to budge on providing the information sooner, this has delayed 3 closings that were to happen concurrently. Despite asking for a supervisor, which I was never given access to, they refuse to give the information until mid-day Friday  XX/XX/XXXX although the first attempt was made XX/XX/XXXX with little communication on Freedom Mortgage 's part through this entire process. This has caused a huge inconvenience for many people involved that should have not occurred due to their untimely responses and refusal to provide the information that was asked 18 days prior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "57436  XX/XX/XXXX- I received a call from someone claiming they were from XXXX County Court system and said they were in attempt to serve me in attempt to sue. I told him I had never been served and he replied that \" we wanted to see if you would resolve with company directly via telephone ''. He explained he could not tell me what it was about, but he could give me a phone number and a case number. That was XXXX XXXX XXXX and case number # XXXX. He then offered to connect me, I said go ahead. A lady by the name of \" XXXX XXXX '' ( EXT. XXXX ) answered and said she was from \" XXXX XXXX ''. She explained that XXXX was the 4th \" chain and Title '' of debt owed to Victoria Secret for amount {$390.00} from year XX/XX/XXXX. I was confused, because according to my credit report I had paid off all my credit card debt in the past 3 years ( even old debt ), she claimed Victoria secret does not report to the credit bureau. I told her that I thought I paid this off, she asked for a \" paid in full letter '' and I told her I didn't have my records. She then continued and discussed payment plans/options for me. I said I would need to call her back to verify all the chain and titles. I called back two days later XX/XX/XXXX and left a voicemail asking for a call back. She called back and I asked if she could send a letter to my home with the information of the debt that I owe. She said she could not do that. I asked for a manager. I waited on hold and a \" manager '' came on the line and proceeded to tell me a letter can not be sent, but that they could email me. When they could clearly see my hesitation, he proceeded with very detailed threats like the year, make, and model of my car and that they would be placing a lien on it for this debt. He continued to try and intimidate me with very specific information like my address, job, bank that I bank with etc. He continued with these threats and said if I do not pay they will sue me. I was still hesitant and kindly explained that they must understand my hesitation as I would be giving them sensitive information to pay this debt and with all the fraud out there, it is very scary. I told him that since they refused the one thing I asked for ( a letter by mail ), that I would like to speak to the manager above him. He then placed me on hold and put the another person on the line ; It was very repetitive, almost like a script..I asked for a letter and explained my concerns and he had the same very detailed threats, but when I wasn't budging he laughed and said \" we aren't here to please you or cater to your request, you are the one who owes a debt that you never paid in XX/XX/XXXX, if the debt is not paid you will be sued and it will double in court fees ''. There was a lot of back and fourth about the letter I requested and they refuse to send. He said that he emailed me one and I checked the email it was very plainly made and had no address or header. I told him this and his explanation is that \" they didn't give their address out because of people like me ''. I told him he was being very rude and inconsiderate and he responded with \" you're a joke ''. I told him if they refused to send the letter fine, I will do my research and according to the first lady I had until XX/XX/XXXX to pay the debt at a discount for {$230.00}. I told him we would speak then and hung up.I believe my rights with debt collectors is that they are not allowed to give very detailed threats about taking possession of things such as ; my car. I also realize they can not threaten to sue when there is not in fact a lawsuit in place. They went against my rights and I still do not have confidence this is a reputable company as Victoria Secret DOES report to the credit bureau and XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have a record of XXXX XXXX ANYWHERE. All I have is a phone call to go off of.This could be anyone and their lack of professionalism doesn't sell them either. The email I received came from XXXX XXXX ( 2nd person I spoke with and so called manager )  XXXX. I have attached the so called official letter that was only emailed to me. I have not received any previous correspondence from XXXX XXXX.                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

We remain unable to provide any further details regarding the reasons why the application was declined and are unable to approve your credit request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "57438  I made a purchase at The Home Depot at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Fl. on XX/XX/2019 and at the same time applied for a Credit Card. I made it clear that I was paying for the product with my Debit Card and was not charging anything on the credit card. I paid with my debit card and the cashier also put the same purchase on the credit card. I have called Home Depot corporate office, been to the store twice, called the credit department twice, written the credit department but to this day, The Home Depot will not remove the charge from the credit card. The purchase was for {$82.00} and now with late fees the balance on the card is {$150.00} and they continue to send me a bill in the mail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "57440  This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application. I highly recommend you generate verification that Credit Union has been reported completely in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulations, it's really a serious problem to misreport. More confirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request must over, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I'm not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct.

I have submitted all of my information needed to resolve this matter in this complaint and through the FTC report attached and do not feel comfortable giving any further information in any way to any others at this time due to the further possibilities of identity theft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "57443  I would like to get rid of the PMI insurance on my mortgage as my mortgage is nearly 20 % paid off. \\n\\nI attempted to do this several years ago and was told there was no way to do it until it was 20 % paid ( despite the value of the home FAR exceeding the ratio required to drop ). \\n\\nPlanet Home Lending has made it as difficult as possible to gain any information about doing this. Reading now it looks as though I likely could have dropped the PMI if I got the home assessed, but they never disclosed that in my communications with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "57446  Numerous tries to pay a large amount towards principal balance. My last call was today XX/XX/XXXX and after being on hold to speak to supervisor was told to send my payment wire transfer to XXXX XXXX ABA # XXXX A/C # XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX at XXXX and they do not even have my account, the a/c # I gave them they told me was inactive since XXXX. Called Lakeview # XXXX to speak to a loan specialist and they gave me a different number which is not in service # XXXX. XXXX is suppose to be handling my mortgage but supposedly they only take the payments for Lakeview. The number I have for XXXX  is XXXX. Can you please help me? I am unable to talk to anyone that knows how I can make a large principal payment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "57448  I am attempting to make a payment toward my student loans on the Nelnet website today, XX/XX/20, and Nelnet will not allow me to post the payment sooner than XX/XX/20. By the time the payment posts, 2-3 days of additional interest will have accrued and my payments will apply more to interest than is due today, the day that I'm attempting to pay. My understanding was that I could make a payment at any time but this does not appear to be true. The funds are available in my bank account today regardless of whether Nelnet can collect over the weekend. I should not be penalized for this. \\n\\nI submitted complaint XXXX in XXXX for other deceptive practices with Nelnet. They have not yet resolved the issue identified in that complaint or contacted me as they said they would in their response. I believe this new issue is just one more deceptive practice by this company that causes financial harm to borrowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "57451  I am a customer with Wells Fargo Bank. Recently money was withdrawn on a couple of occasions without my permission or consent to pay for a timeshare account that was never used by me nor anyone connected to me because of unfair policies pertaining to the fees of the said timeshare. I tried cancelling the said timeshare account several times because of these fees that were never mentioned at the initiation. My account was debited to pay for the timeshare fees without my knowledge or consent several times. I tried correcting this with Wells Fargo bank with no avail. I would appreciate it if you can look into this matter for me. I was left with no funds in my account and as such I could not take care of the basic necessities of my day to day life. \\nThanks in advance,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "57452  I spoken with them several times in a year. An in XXXX they informed me yes they sold my information to a third party without my knowledge.

I soon deposited approximately {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX into the account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email update from Citibank about the offer and thanking me for enrolling in the Citibank {$200.00} checking offer and repeating the terms of the agreement. \\n\\nOn or about XX/XX/XXXX I utilized the Citibank Mobile Application 's chat function to inquire as to when my bonus might be depositing, as it had been well over 60 days since when I opened the account and deposited the qualifying funds on XX/XX/XXXX. 60 days since my deposit would have been around early XX/XX/XXXX. The Mobile Application representative stated they could not resolve the issue and to call their One Stop Sales Unit, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative at the One Stop Sales Unit was confused and did not know how to search for the offer clearly, saying too that often the offers are for holding money in the account for 90 days or more, and provided essentially no clarity or guidance. \\n\\nI withdrew {$3000.00} of the {$5000.00} I had held in the account since XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, my first withdrawl from the account. I am concerned as Citibank has been very unclear on when my deposit bonus will be depositing, as that is {$5000.00} I could be storing in other accounts that actually provided material interest income ( which are generally well over 1.7 % at the moment compared to Citibank Basic Checking 's essential zero interest ). Furthermore Citibank makes it extremely difficult to get any clear, definite answers on the matter as neither their chat representative nor their One Stop Sales Unit personnel have any meaningful knowledge on how to handle the matter.</td>\n",

       "46281  On or about XX/XX/XXXX I opened a Citibank Basic Checking Account after seeing an offer described by Citibank that if I opened a Basic Checking Account, deposited at least {$5000.00} within 30 days of accounting opening, and held at least that amount in the account for 60 days that within 90 days after fulfilling the conditions of the agreement I would receive a {$200.00} checking account bonus. I soon deposited approximately {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX into the account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another email update from Citibank about the offer and thanking me for enrolling in the Citibank {$200.00} checking offer and repeating the terms of the agreement. \\n\\nOn or about XX/XX/XXXX I utilized the Citibank Mobile Application 's chat function to inquire as to when my bonus might be depositing, as it had been well over 60 days since when I opened the account and deposited the qualifying funds on XX/XX/XXXX. 60 days since my deposit would have been around early XX/XX/XXXX. The Mobile Application representative stated they could not resolve the issue and to call their One Stop Sales Unit, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative at the One Stop Sales Unit was confused and did not know how to search for the offer clearly, saying too that often the offers are for holding money in the account for 90 days or more, and provided essentially no clarity or guidance. \\n\\nI withdrew {$3000.00} of the {$5000.00} I had held in the account since XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, my first withdrawl from the account. I am concerned as Citibank has been very unclear on when my deposit bonus will be depositing, as that is {$5000.00} I could be storing in other accounts that actually provided material interest income ( which are generally well over 1.7 % at the moment compared to Citibank Basic Checking 's essential zero interest ). Furthermore Citibank makes it extremely difficult to get any clear, definite answers on the matter as neither their chat representative nor their One Stop Sales Unit personnel have any meaningful knowledge on how to handle the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

I was confused because it was the first of the month and I had not deposited any checks since the previous month. I called BB &amp; T and they said that I couldnt deposit checks into business accounts via the mobile app even though I had done that before. \\n\\nI was instructed to open a personal account, into which I could deposit checks via the mobile app. I was told that if I opened the account online I would have immediate access, that I could link my personal and business accounts, and immediately be able to transfer money between them. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened my personal account online. Though I successfully opened online, I did not have online access as I had been promised. Because I was traveling in an area where there were no BB &amp; T branches, I could not go into a branch until XX/XX/2019. In the intervening time, my business account became overdrawn. I had the money in my personal account to bring it back into the black, but BB &amp; T could not make the transfer until I went into a branch. During this time, I incurred an astonishing {$320.00} in overdraft fees in my business account because I had no way of transferring money between the two accounts. \\n\\nWhen I went into the branch, I met with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX County, Florida. She investigated the accounts and told me she would link them and that I would have online access in XXXX hours. The online access still never material, I was not able to transfer money and I received an additional {$36.00} overdraft fee. This brought the total to {$360.00} in overdraft fees. \\n\\nI had only opened the second account on BB &amp; Ts advice ; I could have had my customer send a bank wire directly into business account in the first week of XXXX to keep the account positive.

I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service.

       "30060  I have a business checking account at BB & T. On XX/XX/2019, I attempted to deposit a check into my account and I received a message stating that I was over my monthly mobile deposit limit. I was confused because it was the first of the month and I had not deposited any checks since the previous month. I called BB & T and they said that I couldnt deposit checks into business accounts via the mobile app even though I had done that before. \\n\\nI was instructed to open a personal account, into which I could deposit checks via the mobile app. I was told that if I opened the account online I would have immediate access, that I could link my personal and business accounts, and immediately be able to transfer money between them. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened my personal account online. Though I successfully opened online, I did not have online access as I had been promised. Because I was traveling in an area where there were no BB & T branches, I could not go into a branch until XX/XX/2019. In the intervening time, my business account became overdrawn. I had the money in my personal account to bring it back into the black, but BB & T could not make the transfer until I went into a branch. During this time, I incurred an astonishing {$320.00} in overdraft fees in my business account because I had no way of transferring money between the two accounts. \\n\\nWhen I went into the branch, I met with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX County, Florida. She investigated the accounts and told me she would link them and that I would have online access in XXXX hours. The online access still never material, I was not able to transfer money and I received an additional {$36.00} overdraft fee. This brought the total to {$360.00} in overdraft fees. \\n\\nI had only opened the second account on BB & Ts advice ; I could have had my customer send a bank wire directly into business account in the first week of XXXX to keep the account positive. My TOTAL deposits between the two accounts was always positive. \\n\\nI requested a refund and was told they would not refund any of the fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

To my knowledge I didnt owe a payment because the account wasnt being used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "20993  I first applied for the Fedloan Serving program in XXXX in hopes of getting loan forgiveness since I've been paying on my student loans since late XXXX or early XXXX and I have been a public servant since XXXX, XXXX. I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.   \n",
       "53     On several occasions ( XXXX ) I have tried to reach someone in costumer service today XX/XX/2020 I tried again to get through and was on hold for over 20 minutes and hung up. \\n\\n3 Years ago I have made no more than {$600.00} in purchases, and while making payments on my account with a {$9000.00} limit the interest charges are deducted from the credit limit and the interest was based on the balance each month. this left my interest and charge fess higher than my monthly payment which amounted to around {$240.00} each month. \\n\\nIn all of this time the interest was so big that it completely eat up the limit balance on the card, which left in me in a vicious cycle of never paying down the money owed. with in 2 years I was able to get the balance down {$2000.00} and I asked Walmart Capital One to reduce the balance down. Now it is back up to the high bank fees and interest charges that have again gone beyond what I can afford monthly the {$240.00}. This is a unfair and infantile game that is forced on me as an consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
